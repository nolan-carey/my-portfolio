                                    interface (GUI) development for me. Tkinter, being Python's standard GUI toolkit, offered a procedural method of
                                    creating the interface which, while straightforward, required meticulous attention to detail to ensure that every
                                    element worked harmoniously.

                                    <br>
                                    The task was to build an application that could fetch and display stock prices in a readable and interactive chart
                                    format. This was particularly challenging because it required integrating financial knowledge with practical coding
                                    skills. Each element, from the input fields for the ticker symbol and time period to the display of historical and
                                    implied volatility, needed to work seamlessly to provide users with real-time financial data.

                                    As I coded the application, I learned valuable lessons about the design of user interfaces, particularly in how to make
                                    complex information accessible. Ensuring that the stock price chart was clear and easy to read was a top priority. This
                                    meant not only fine-tuning the aesthetics, such as the color scheme and layout but also ensuring the responsiveness of
                                    the interface so that users could interact with the data effectively.

                                    The experience of fetching and manipulating financial data, and then presenting it in a user-friendly format, was
                                    immensely rewarding. It honed my skills in Python and deepened my understanding of event-driven programming. More
                                    importantly, it taught me the importance of user-centered design in financial software development—a principle that I
                                    now appreciate is as crucial as any technical skill. The project was a significant first step in my journey to master
                                    GUI development with a focus on enhancing user experience.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">Creating this GUI for finance homework was both a practical and innovative approach to understanding derivative and
                                    profit mapping. Instead of manually plotting these financial instruments, I decided to delve into the world of
                                    programming to construct a tool that could automate the process. The GUI was designed to take in variables such as the
                                    price of securities, number of securities, and the strike price, then calculate and visually map the position of bonds,
                                    stocks, calls, and puts.

                                    Coding this GUI required a deep dive into both my financial knowledge and programming capabilities. I chose to use a
                                    framework that allowed me to construct a user-friendly interface while also handling the computational logic required
                                    for financial calculations. The interactive graph that resulted from the input data was a visual representation of the
                                    theoretical concepts I was learning, bringing to life the abstract concepts of derivative pricing and profit mapping.

                                    This tool not only served my immediate need for a more efficient way to handle homework assignments but also provided a
                                    hands-on learning experience. It underscored the importance of financial technology in modern finance studies and
                                    practice. By automating the graphing of option payoffs and other derivative positions, I gained a clearer understanding
                                    of the financial principles at play. Moreover, the project honed my skills in designing interfaces that are both
                                    functional and intuitive, ensuring that even complex financial analyses could be accessible and understandable. This GUI
                                    was a testament to the power of combining programming skills with financial acumen, a synergy that I continue to explore
                                    and develop in my academic and professional journey.

                                    The development of this GUI was not just a programming exercise; it was a practical application of robotics principles.
                                    It enabled me to explore the physical constraints and capabilities of the robotic arm before the actual build, thus
                                    saving time, resources, and guiding the hardware design with insights gained from the software model.

                                    By adjusting parameters such as arm lengths and target positions, I could immediately see the effects on the arm's
                                    configuration. The GUI provided a visual feedback loop that was essential for understanding the inverse kinematics
                                    involved – the complex calculations that determine joint angles based on the desired position of the arm's end effector.

                                    This tool bridged the gap between theoretical robotics and real-world application. It allowed for rapid prototyping,
                                    ensuring that when I moved to the construction phase, I had a solid foundation of how the arm should perform. This
                                    pre-emptive approach was crucial, especially considering the precision required for plasma cutting tasks. The GUI was a
                                    testament to how software can inform and enhance the engineering design process, providing a clear path from concept to
                                    creation.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">Working on the Monte Carlo simulation component of my simple-fin project was an educational journey that greatly
                                    enhanced my financial and programming acumen. This feature wasn't just a static tool but a dynamic model that brought to
                                    light the unpredictable nature of financial markets and the power of simulation to capture this uncertainty.
                                    <br>

                                    The project honed my skills in Python programming, particularly in utilizing libraries suited for mathematical
                                    computation and data visualization. Through iterative coding and testing, I learned to translate complex financial
                                    theories into executable code, embodying the principles of Monte Carlo methods in a practical application.
                                    <br>

                                        This embedded systems project showcases a creative and practical application in the form of a robotic cooking pan
                                        capable of flipping food automatically. It's a multifaceted endeavor that incorporates various aspects of mechanical and
                                        electrical engineering, along with computer-aided design (CAD), to bring to life a device that enhances the cooking

                                        The project included designing the physical structure in CAD software, which allowed for precise planning and
                                        visualization of the mechanical components such as the linear actuators and the framework that supports the flipping
                                        mechanism. The electrical schematics were integral in ensuring that the components like relays and actuators worked in
                                        tandem to control the movement of the pan efficiently.

                                        <br>
                                        In the prototype stage, the iterative process of testing and refining the design was crucial. It involved
                                        troubleshooting the hardware, refining the code for the microcontrollers, and ensuring that the actuators received the
                                        correct signals to perform the flipping action.

                                        A key feature of this device is the embedded system control that coordinates the hardware components. The linear
                                        actuators, chosen for their precision and reliability, are the muscles of the device, while the relays act as the
                                        switches controlling the actuators’ power supply based on the signals from the embedded system.

                                        Reflecting on the project, I see the potential for further enhancements. Integrating temperature sensors could provide a
                                        more responsive cooking experience by flipping the food when it reaches the optimal cooking temperature. Additionally, a
                                        timer setting could offer the user more control, allowing for precise cooking times for different types of food. These
                                        improvements would make the robotic cooking pan more autonomous and user-friendly, capable of accommodating a wider
                                        variety of cooking styles and preferences.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The experience gained from this project is invaluable, highlighting the intersection of mechanical design, electrical
                                        engineering, and embedded system programming. The skills learned here are not just applicable to the culinary world but
                                        can be transferred to other domains requiring automation and precision. If this project were to be revisited, the
                                        addition of sensors and enhanced user controls would represent the next step in its evolution, illustrating the
                                        iterative nature of engineering design.

                                        This image depicts a computer vision project that integrates a variety of technologies and skills to create a system
                                        capable of tracking faces and directing a servo-motor-controlled toy gun towards the detected position. It's a complex
                                        setup that serves as a practical example of applied robotics, combining elements of mechanical design, electronics, and
                                        software engineering.

                                        The project involved designing parts in CAD software, which were then brought to life through 3D printing, showcasing
                                        the synergy between digital design and physical manufacturing. The mechanical housing and mounts for the servo motors
                                        were precisely calculated to ensure accurate movement and alignment with the vision system's output.

                                        <br>
                                        At the heart of the operation is an Arduino microcontroller, chosen for its accessibility and versatility. It interprets
                                        the data received from the computer vision algorithm—developed using the OpenCV library—and translates it into motion
                                        commands for the servo motors. This interplay between software and hardware is critical for real-time face tracking and
                                        the subsequent targeting mechanism.

                                        The use of OpenCV for face detection highlights the power of computer vision techniques. OpenCV (Open Source Computer
                                        Vision Library) is a library of programming functions aimed at real-time computer vision, and in this project, it is
                                        used to process visual data and identify facial features.

                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Reflecting on the project, it is evident that a system like this could be enhanced with additional features such as
                                        motion prediction to improve tracking accuracy or safety mechanisms to ensure responsible usage. The integration of CAD
                                        design, 3D printing, microcontroller programming, and computer vision creates a robust framework for similar automated
                                        systems, potentially extending to applications beyond the scope of this prototype. This project not only sharpened
                                        technical skills across multiple domains but also provided a deep understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of
                                        robotics projects.

                                        As I develop my personal portfolio website, I'm employing Flask and Bootstrap, two powerful tools that complement each
                                        other beautifully. Flask is serving as the backbone of my site, thanks to its lightweight nature and ability to scale
                                        with complexity. It's an ideal choice for a developer like me who values the elegance of Python and wants to maintain a
                                        clean and maintainable codebase.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <br>


                                        Bootstrap is the framework I've chosen for the front-end. Its responsiveness and mobile-first philosophy are crucial for
                                        ensuring that my site is accessible on any device, which is imperative in today's multi-screen world. I'm leveraging
                                        Bootstrap's pre-built components and grid system to create an aesthetically pleasing layout that's also functional,
                                        allowing me to showcase my projects in a well-organized manner.

                                            <br>
                                        Integrating Flask and Bootstrap has been a smooth process. Flask's templating engine Jinja2 works seamlessly with
                                        Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript components. This integration allows me to efficiently render my portfolio's content on
                                        the web pages, creating a dynamic user experience that's both fast and reliable.

                                                <br>
                                        As I add each project to my portfolio, from the embedded systems designs to the computer vision applications, I'm
                                        reminded of the importance of having a central repository that not only displays my work but also reflects my growth as
                                        a developer. This website is not just a showcase of my past achievements; it's a continual work in progress that evolves
                                        with my career. It's where I consolidate my learning, experiment with new technologies, and present my professional
                                        narrative to the world.
